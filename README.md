# Decimal_Binary_Hex-Convertor

Another small effort in c# and winforms again designed as a quick easy tool for programmers.
Still some design work to be carried out but should be fully functional.

Click the base you wish - Decimal, Binary or Hexadecimal and enter your digit and conversion occurs automatically to the 
other bases.
